# üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy

## Overview

The BAUER GROUP Automation Templates repository is committed to maintaining the highest security standards for our enterprise automation infrastructure. This document outlines our security policies, procedures for reporting vulnerabilities, and best practices for contributors.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Immediate Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it immediately through one of the following channels:

#### 1. GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)
- Navigate to [Security Advisories](https://github.com/bauer-group/automation-templates/security/advisories)
- Click "Report a vulnerability"
- Provide detailed information using our template

#### 2. Email Reporting
- **Email**: support@bauer-group.com
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Automation Templates Vulnerability Report`

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
3. **Reproduction**: Step-by-step reproduction instructions
4. **Affected Components**: Specific workflows, actions, or configurations
5. **Suggested Fix**: If you have recommendations
6. **Contact Information**: Your preferred contact method

### Response Timeline

| Severity | Initial Response | Status Update | Resolution Target |
|----------|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Critical** | 2 hours | Daily | 7 days |
| **High** | 24 hours | Weekly | 30 days |
| **Medium** | 3 days | Bi-weekly | 90 days |
| **Low** | 7 days | Monthly | 180 days |

## üîê Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for supported versions:

| Version | Support Status | Security Updates |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| 1.8.1 (current) | ‚úÖ Full Support | ‚úÖ Yes |
| v1.8.0 | ‚ùå End of Life | ‚ùå No |
| v1.7.0 | ‚ùå End of Life | ‚ùå No |
| v1.6.1 | ‚ùå End of Life | ‚ùå No |
| v1.6.0 | ‚ùå End of Life | ‚ùå No |

### Version Support Policy

- **Current Version**: Full feature and security support for the latest release (1.8.1)
- **Previous Versions**: No support provided - users should upgrade to the current version
- **Security Updates**: Only applied to the current version

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Repository Security

#### 1. Access Control
- **Branch Protection**: `main` branch protected with required reviews
- **Required Checks**: All CI/CD security scans must pass
- **Administrative Access**: Limited to core maintainers
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Required for all contributors

#### 2. Automated Security Scanning

We implement multiple layers of automated security scanning:

##### Secrets Detection
```yaml
# Gitleaks - Open Source Secrets Scanning
- name: üîç Secrets Scan (Gitleaks)
  uses: gitleaks/gitleaks-action@v2
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# GitGuardian - Enterprise Secrets Detection
- name: üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Secrets Scan (GitGuardian)
  uses: GitGuardian/ggshield-action@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY }}
```

##### Dependency Scanning
```yaml
# Security Advisories Check
- name: üìä Security Advisory Scan
  uses: github/super-linter@v4
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    VALIDATE_GITHUB_ACTIONS: true
```

##### Code Quality & Security
```yaml
# CodeQL Analysis
- name: üîç CodeQL Analysis
  uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
  with:
    languages: javascript, yaml
```

#### 3. Supply Chain Security

##### Pinned Dependencies
All GitHub Actions are pinned to specific SHA hashes:
```yaml
# ‚úÖ Secure - Pinned to SHA
uses: actions/checkout@8ade135a41bc03ea155e62e844d188df1ea18608

# ‚ùå Insecure - Using mutable tag
uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

##### Dependency Updates
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates with security patches
- **Review Process**: All dependency updates reviewed by maintainers
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before merging updates

### Workflow Security

#### 1. Permissions Model
All workflows follow the principle of least privilege:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read        # Minimal read access
  security-events: write # Only for security scanning
  pull-requests: write   # Only when needed for PR actions
```

#### 2. Secret Management

##### Secret Scoping
- **Repository Secrets**: For repository-specific configurations
- **Organization Secrets**: For shared enterprise resources
- **Environment Secrets**: For deployment-specific credentials

##### Secret Naming Convention
Following our [Secrets Naming Convention](github/workflows/SECRETS-NAMING-CONVENTION.MD):

```
<SCOPE>_<SERVICE>_<PURPOSE>_<FORMAT>
```

Examples:
- `SECURITY_GITGUARDIAN_API_KEY` - GitGuardian API key
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` - Docker registry authentication
- `SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` - Code signing certificate

#### 3. Input Validation
All workflow inputs are validated and sanitized:

```yaml
# Example: Secure input validation
- name: üîç Validate Input
  run: |
    # Sanitize user input
    INPUT=$(echo "${{ github.event.inputs.user_input }}" | tr -cd '[:alnum:]._-')
    if [[ ! "$INPUT" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$ ]]; then
      echo "‚ùå Invalid input format"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## üö´ Security Boundaries

### What We Protect Against

1. **Secret Exposure**: Prevention of API keys, tokens, and credentials leakage
2. **Code Injection**: Protection against malicious code injection in workflows
3. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Verification of dependencies and actions
4. **Unauthorized Access**: Strong access controls and authentication
5. **Data Exfiltration**: Prevention of sensitive data leakage

### What We Don't Protect Against

1. **Client-Side Security**: Security of consuming repositories
2. **Infrastructure Security**: GitHub's infrastructure security
3. **End-User Applications**: Security of applications built using our templates
4. **Third-Party Services**: Security of external services integrated via our workflows

## üìã Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

#### 1. Development Security
- **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables and GitHub secrets
- **Validate all inputs**: Sanitize and validate workflow inputs
- **Use pinned versions**: Pin action versions to specific SHAs
- **Minimal permissions**: Request only necessary permissions
- **Regular updates**: Keep dependencies updated

#### 2. Code Review Security Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Permissions scoped appropriately
- [ ] Dependencies pinned to secure versions
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Logging doesn't contain secrets

#### 3. Workflow Security Guidelines

##### Secure Action Usage
```yaml
# ‚úÖ Secure
- name: Secure Action Usage
  uses: actions/checkout@8ade135a41bc03ea155e62e844d188df1ea18608
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    fetch-depth: 1

# ‚ùå Insecure
- name: Insecure Action Usage
  uses: actions/checkout@main  # Mutable reference
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}  # Overprivileged
```

##### Environment Isolation
```yaml
# ‚úÖ Secure environment handling
jobs:
  secure-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production  # Explicit environment
    steps:
      - name: Deploy with Environment Secrets
        run: echo "Deploying safely"
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.PRODUCTION_API_KEY }}
```

### For Users

#### 1. Implementation Security
- **Review workflows**: Understand what workflows do before using
- **Secure secrets**: Store secrets securely in GitHub secrets
- **Regular updates**: Keep automation templates updated
- **Monitor usage**: Regular audit of workflow usage and permissions

#### 2. Integration Security
- **Least privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions
- **Network security**: Use secure connections and VPNs when required
- **Audit logs**: Regular review of workflow execution logs
- **Incident response**: Have a plan for security incidents

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring

We implement comprehensive security monitoring:

1. **Automated Scanning**: Daily security scans on all workflows
2. **Dependency Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for vulnerable dependencies
3. **Access Monitoring**: Audit logs for all administrative actions
