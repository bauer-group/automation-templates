# This is the CODEOWNERS file for the repository.
# It defines who is responsible (owner) for reviewing changes to certain files or folders.
# When someone opens a pull request that modifies these files,
# GitHub will automatically request a review from the listed owners.

# Syntax:
#   pattern   owner(s)
# - Patterns work like .gitignore rules (wildcards, folders, extensions).
# - Owners can be GitHub usernames (@username) or organization teams (@org/team).
# - Multiple owners can be assigned, separated by spaces.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Default rule: assign all files (*) in the repository to @karlspace.
# This means every pull request will automatically request a review from you,
# unless a more specific rule matches first.
*   @karlspace
